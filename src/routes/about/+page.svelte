		zesty.plus is a music visualizer, inspired by what iTunes did back in the
		days of yore. How it functions is simple: it analyzes incoming microphone
		data and produces fun doodles from it. It also has optional music service
		and camera integration features, but that stuff isn't required if you want a
		pure, organic experience.
